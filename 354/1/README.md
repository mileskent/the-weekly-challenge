# Task 1: Min Abs Diff
**Monday, Dec 29, 2025**

You are given an array of distinct integers.

Write a script to find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference.

```
Rules (a,b):
1: a, b are from the given array.
2: a < b
3: b - a = min abs diff any two elements in the given array
```

## Example 1
```
Input: @ints= (4, 2, 1, 3)
Output: [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]
```

## Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (10, 100, 20, 30)
Output: [10, 20], [20, 30]
```

## Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (-5, -2, 0, 3)
Output: [-2, 0]
```

## Example 4
```
Input: @ints = (8, 1, 15, 3)
Output: [1, 3]
```

## Example 5
```
Input: @ints = (12, 5, 9, 1, 15)
Output: [9, 12], [12, 15]
```
