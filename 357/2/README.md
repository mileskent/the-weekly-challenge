# Unique Fraction Generator

Given a positive integer N, generate all unique fractions you can create using integers from 1 to N and follow the rules below:
- Use numbers 1 through N only (no zero)
- Create fractions like numerator/denominator
- List them in ascending order (from smallest to largest)
- If two fractions have the same value (like 1/2 and 2/4),
  only show the one with the smallest numerator
